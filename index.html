    <h1>hello world</h1>
    <h2>didn't come up automatically</h2>
    <h3>message stating,without head and body tag live stream cannot run automatically</h3>
    <h3>reason that we're choosing body is because if we'd have done it in head then browser gets busy executing the contents of the head without comming to the content of the page defined in the body thereby creating bad user exprience</h3>
    <h4>user sees a page w/b while browser is busy parsing the js code in the head</h4>
    <script src="arraysTupples.js">
        //log a statement in console
        //html all about content, js is all about behaviour
